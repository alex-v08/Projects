Trivy (`tri` pronounced like **tri**gger, `vy` pronounced like en**vy**) is a comprehensive security scanner. It is reliable, fast, extremely easy to use, and it works wherever you need it.

Trivy has different *scanners* that look for different security issues, and different *targets* where it can find those issues.

Targets:
- Container Image
- Filesystem
- Git repository (remote)
- Kubernetes cluster or resource

Scanners:
- OS packages and software dependencies in use (SBOM)
- Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- IaC misconfigurations
- Sensitive information and secrets

Much more scanners and targets are coming up. Missing something? Let us know!

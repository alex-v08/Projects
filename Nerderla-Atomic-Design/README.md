<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

A list of things that you need to install for run the project.

-   [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/)

-   Yarn

```sh
brew install yarn
```

> If you're a Windows user,
> [download the installer](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable).

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined in
[Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) files. Dotenv is a zero-dependency
module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

For the build to run successfully, you will need to create a `.env` that
contains the following data:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_SPACE_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_ENV=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```
